# Create a passwordless appication account

To create a passwordless application account with sudo on Ubuntu, add a line to the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory, specifying the user, their allowed actions, and the NOPASSWD option. This allows the user to run sudo commands without a password.
Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Create a New User (if needed):

If you don't already have an application user, create one using the adduser command:
Code

```
sudo adduser <application_username>
```

You'll be prompted to set a password for this user, which is fine for now.

### 2. Add the User to the sudo Group:

Use the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group:
Code

```
sudo usermod -aG sudo <application_username>
```

This grants the user the ability to use sudo.

### 3. Edit the sudoers File:

Use the visudo command to edit the /etc/sudoers file (this is a safer way to edit this file than using a regular text editor).
Code

```
sudo visudo
```

Navigate to the end of the file (or to the line containing includedir /etc/sudoers.d/).
Add a line specifying the user, their allowed actions, and the NOPASSWD option:
Code

```
<application_username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Replace <application_username> with the actual username of the application account.
This line allows the user to run all commands with sudo without a password.

### 4. Save and Exit:

Save the changes in visudo (usually by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, and then Enter).

### 5. Test the Configuration:

Log in as the application user (using su - <application_username>).

```
su - <application_username>
```

Try running a sudo command (e.g., sudo ls /root).

```
sudo ls /root
```

You should be able to run the command without being prompted for a password.

## Important Security Considerations:

### Security Risk:

Enabling passwordless sudo for a user can be a security risk if the user's account is compromised.

### Alternative Approaches:

Consider using SSH key-based authentication instead of passwordless sudo for a more secure solution.

### Specific Commands:

Instead of allowing all commands with sudo without a password, you can restrict the
